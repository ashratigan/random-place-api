# Random place generator 
## Overview
This is the back end for an application that randomly generates a city on Earth or a planet from the Star Wars Universe when a user clicks on the respective button. Data for the cities was generated from a CSV file downloaded from [Simple Maps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities). The star wars planets are accessed through [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), the Stars Wars API. This project was created as an added bonus to my Bucket List project as a place for people to look for travel inspiration. 

The front end repository: https://github.com/ashratigan/random-place-client

The website is deployed at: https://ashratigan.github.io/random-place-client/

The back end is hosted on heroku at: https://desolate-plateau-52113.herokuapp.com/
