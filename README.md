# Random place generator 
## Overview
This will be the back end for an application that randomly generates a city on Earth or a planet from the Star Wars Universe when a user clicks on the respective button. Data for the cities was generated from a CSV file downloaded from ![Simple Maps](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities). The star wars planets are accessed through ![SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), the Stars Wars API. This project was created as an added bonus to my Bucket List project as a place for people to look for travel inspiration.
